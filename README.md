# Mini-Project-1-Notes-Application

This app has two functionalities. One is to create notes and save them in a database with a title and the other is to delete a note by entering the title of the note to delete.
This app doesn't can't display the notes back to the user. So to see them again after saving the user would have to go into the database and check the entries there.
